# PASSWORD BREACH CHECKER API USING PYTHON :

'''
Example:
Enter a list of Passwords 
And it will show suggestion of the best unused 
or low breached password
Input:
    password_breach_finder([--- List of the passwords that you're going to use ---])
Output:
If,
Password was breached : 
"Entered password" was found "No.of times the password breached" breached..
So, Use a better password.

A good password was entered : 
"Entered password" is not found to be breached, 
Carry on with it...!!

NOTE:
Used API-Key from : 'haveibeenpwned.com'
